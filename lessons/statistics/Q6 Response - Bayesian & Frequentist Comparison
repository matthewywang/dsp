Frequentism vs Bayesianism are two different techniques/approaches to statistics.  

Frequentist statistics involves drawing inferences/conclusions from sample data by emphasizing the frequency 
or proportion of the data.  Sampling is infinite, and hence probabilities are derived from long run frequency 
distributions.  Data are a repeatable random sample, and data vary.  Underlying parameters are fixed.  
Frequentist statistics does not assign probabilities to hypotheses or to any unknown values in general.  
Techniques include confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

Bayesian statistics also involves drawing inferences/conclusions, but will also incorporate prior 
history/knowledge/data/assumptions.  Unknown quantities are treated probabilistically.  Data are fixed and 
observed from the realized sample.  Parameters vary and are described probabilistically (conditional 
probabilities).  Bayesian statistics may start with a prior probability assuming a specific hypothesis is 
true (based on prior history or assumptions), and then over time that probability gets updated as more 
data gets collected/samples are observed.  Bayesian statistics uses probabilities to represent uncertainty 
in an event or hypothesis.
